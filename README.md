# Face-Recognition
Face Recognition with Machine learning (PCA+KNN &amp; PCA+DF/RF)

# Introduction
Face recognition system compares the image with the database to perform function of identification. We are interested 
in building a classification model for the individuals in our database and predicting the accurate individual from the 
input image. We would also like to investigate whether we should apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to 
simplify the large dataset before classification. We have proposed three approaches for classification. They are using
PCA with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), PCA with decision tree and PCA with random forest. Comparison of the three 
approaches would also be made.
